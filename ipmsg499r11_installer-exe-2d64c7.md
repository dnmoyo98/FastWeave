ipmsg499r11_installer.exe is the installation executable for IP Messenger, a file and message transfer software developed by Shirouzu Hiroaki, with the version number 4.99.11.0. Generally regarded as a legitimate application, IP Messenger enables users to send and receive files and messages over local networks, making it particularly useful for quick communication in office environments. While the executable itself is typically safe, users should always ensure they download software from official sources to avoid potential risks of malware or viruses disguised as legitimate files.

As with any software, it is advisable to run antivirus scans on downloaded files to maintain system security.
